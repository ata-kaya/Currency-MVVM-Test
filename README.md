# Currency-MVVM-Test
# Android Libraries Usage Sample Project

This is a sample project demonstrating the usage of various libraries in an Android application.

## Libraries Used

- **Dagger/Hilt for Dependency Injection:** Dagger is used to manage dependency injection in the application. Hilt, built on top of Dagger, simplifies the process of integrating Dagger in Android apps.

- **Retrofit/OkHttp for API Connection:** Retrofit is used for making API calls in a type-safe manner. OkHttp is the underlying networking library that powers Retrofit, providing efficient HTTP client capabilities.

- **Android Navigation for Fragment Navigation:** The Android Navigation component is used to handle fragment navigation in the application. It provides a simplified way to navigate between different screens and manage back stack behavior.
